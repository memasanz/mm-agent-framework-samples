      "User: What is Microsoft Agent Framework?\n",
      "WeatherAgent: The **Microsoft Agent Framework** is a set of tools, libraries, and APIs developed by Microsoft to enable the creation, deployment, and management of AI-powered agents (sometimes called copilot experiences) in various applications and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key features of the Microsoft Agent Framework:\n",
      "- **Conversational AI:** Allows developers to build intelligent agents that can understand natural language, respond to queries, and perform tasks through text or voice interfaces.\n",
      "- **Integration:** Designed to integrate with other Microsoft products, such as Azure OpenAI Service, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365, and Power Platform.\n",
      "- **Extensibility:** Supports custom logic and plugins so developers can extend agent capabilities for specific business needs.\n",
      "- **Orchestration:** Manages workflows and coordination between user requests, data sources, and agent actions.\n",
      "- **Security & Compliance:** Provides controls and features to ensure secure and compliant operation in enterprise environments.\n",
      "- **Multimodal Support:** May support agents that interact using text, voice, and potentially other media (e.g., images).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Typical Use Cases\n",
      "- **Business copilots** that help users automate tasks, retrieve information, or coordinate meetings.\n",
      "- **Customer support bots** for websites or apps.\n",
      "- **Personal productivity assistants** in Microsoft 365 or Teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Technologies Involved\n",
      "- **Generative AI models** (like GPT via Azure OpenAI)\n",
      "- **Bot Framework** (for developing bots and conversational agents)\n",
      "- **Power Virtual Agents** (no-code bot development platform)\n",
      "- **Graph API** (for connecting to Microsoft 365 data)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Note:\n",
      "- As of 2024, Microsoft has been increasingly referring to its suite of agent building tools and copilot experiences generically as the \"agent framework\" within Azure and Microsoft 365 contexts.\n",
      "- This is distinct from the older \"Microsoft Agent\" software (from the 1990s and early 2000s) which was an animated character-based assistant technology.\n",
